Basic Algorithm:

1. Create player(s)
    * get name
   (*)get starting money

    * create dealer

2. Deal cards
    *in while loop:
        * make players hand (2 cards)
        * ask players how much theyd like to bet
        * ask players if they want to hit or stand
        * if amount is greater than 21, player busts and dealer wins bet amount
        * else, make dealers hand --> hit until amount is >17
            * if amount is greater than players amt, dealer wins, player loses bet amt
                * if amt lost makes players money<= 0, game over
                * ask to play again
                    * if yes, keep names, ask for new starting money, dont break loop
            * else player wins bet amt *2 (i guess)
